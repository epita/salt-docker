#####        Security settings       #####
##########################################
# Enable "open mode", this mode still maintains encryption, but turns off
# authentication, this is only intended for highly secure environments or for
# the situation where your keys end up in a bad state. If you run in open mode
# you do so at your own risk!
open_mode: True

# Enable auto_accept, this setting will automatically accept all incoming
# public keys from the minions. Note that this is insecure.
auto_accept: True

#####      File Server settings      #####
##########################################
# Salt runs a lightweight file server written in zeromq to deliver files to
# minions. This file server is built into the master daemon and does not
# require a dedicated port.

# The file server works on environments passed to the master, each environment
# can have multiple root directories, the subdirectories in the multiple file
# roots cannot match, otherwise the downloaded files will not be able to be
# reliably ensured. A base environment is required to house the top file.
file_roots:
  dev:
    - /srv/salt/dev/states/

top_file_merging_strategy: same
default_top: base

# File Server Backend
#
# To use multiple backends list them in the order they are searched:
fileserver_backend:
  - git
  - roots

# Git File Server Backend Configuration
#
# Optional parameter used to specify the provider to be used for gitfs. Must
# be one of the following: pygit2, gitpython, or dulwich. If unset, then each
# will be tried in that same order, and the first one with a compatible
# version installed will be the provider that is used.
gitfs_provider: pygit2

# When using the git fileserver backend at least one git remote needs to be
# defined. The user running the salt master will need read access to the repo.
#
# The repos will be searched in order to find the file requested by a client
# and the first repo to have the file will return it.
# When using the git backend branches and tags are translated into salt
# environments.
# Note: file:// repos will be treated as a remote, so refs you want used must
# exist in that repo as *local* refs.
gitfs_remotes:

#####         Pillar settings        #####
##########################################
# Salt Pillars allow for the building of global data that can be made selectively
# available to different minions based on minion grain filtering. The Salt
# Pillar is laid out in the same fashion as the file server, with environments,
# a top file and sls files. However, pillar data does not need to be in the
# highstate format, and is generally just key/value pairs.
pillar_roots:
  dev:
    - /srv/salt/dev/pillars

ext_pillar:
  - git:
    - https://github.com/epita/salt-cri/:
      - root: pillars
      - env: base
      - name: base
    - https://github.com/epita/salt-cri/:
      - root: pillars
      - env: dev
      - name: dev

# Recursively merge lists by aggregating them instead of replacing them.
pillar_merge_lists: True

# Git External Pillar (git_pillar) Configuration Options
#
# Specify the provider to be used for git_pillar. Must be either pygit2 or
# gitpython. If unset, then both will be tried in that same order, and the
# first one with a compatible version installed will be the provider that
# is used.
git_pillar_provider: pygit2

# If the branch is omitted from a git_pillar remote, then this branch will
# be used instead
git_pillar_branch: master
